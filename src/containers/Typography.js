        O, reason not the need: our basest beggars 
        Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
        Allow not nature more than nature needs,
        Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
        If only to go warm were gorgeous,
        Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
        Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,-
        You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
        You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
        As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
        If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
        Against their father, fool me not so much
        To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
        And let not women's weapons, water-drops, 
        Stain my man's cheeks! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Nay, if thou talk of reason, then be mute;
        For with good reason I can thee confute.
        If they, which first by nature's sacred law,
        Do owe to me the tribute of their lives;
        If they to whom I always have been kind,
        And bountiful beyond comparison;
        If they, for whom I have undone myself,
        And brought my age unto this extreme want,
        Do now reject, contemn, despise, abhor me,
        What reason moveth thee to sorrow for me?

        Know that we have divided 
        In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
        To shake all cares and business from our age;
        Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
        Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
        And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
        We have this hour a constant will to publish 
        Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
        May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
        Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
        Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
        And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,-
        Since now we will divest us both of rule,
        Interest of territory, cares of state,-
        Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
        That we our largest bounty may extend 
        Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
        Our eldest-born, speak first.

        Dear Gonorill, kind Ragan, sweet Cordella,
        Ye flourishing branches of a kingly stock,
        Sprung from a tree that once did flourish green,
        Whose blossoms now are nipped with winter's frost,
        And pale grim death doth wait upon my steps,
        And summons me unto his next assizes.
        Therefore, dear daughters, as ye tender the safety
        Of him that was the cause of your first being,
        Resolve a doubt which much molests my mind,
        Which of you three to me would prove most kind;
        Which loves me most, and which at my request
        Will soonest yield unto their father's hest. 
      </p>
